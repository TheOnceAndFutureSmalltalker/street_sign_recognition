# Street Sign Recognition
These are the deliverables for Project 2 for Udacity's Self Driving Car Nanodegree.
The code in this project builds, trains, and tests a convolutional neural network for identifying German street signs.

## Deliverable Files

File | Description
------------ | -------------
<a href="https://github.com/TheOnceAndFutureSmalltalker/street_sign_recognition/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb">Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb</a> | Jupyter file of runnable code demonstrating lane line detection and documentation explaining the data, architecture, training approach, testing, and results
<a href="https://rawgit.com/TheOnceAndFutureSmalltalker/street_sign_recognition/master/report.html">report.html</a> | html version of the notebook mentioned above, viewable without a connection to Jupyter server (i.e., does not need a server, all images are inline, etc.)
<a href="https://github.com/TheOnceAndFutureSmalltalker/street_sign_recognition/tree/master/download">download folder</a> | Additional images used for testing
<a href="https://github.com/TheOnceAndFutureSmalltalker/street_sign_recognition/blob/master/writeup.md">writeup.md</a> | FUll description of the project and suggestions for improvement

## Instructions

Currently, this repository does not contain all required dependencies, support files, and instructions for actually running the jupyter notebook.  This to come later.  All results can be viewed on the html versoin of the notebook, report.html.
